      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">Debating</h2>
      <p>I've competed in debating throughout high school and into University. I've had experience as both a debating coach, taking a competitive high school debating team, and as an adjudicator, judging across multiple prestigious high school tournaments.
        Furthermore, I've competed at several University competitions as both a debater and an adjudicator. As a debater I've won the novice finals of UPenn Pre-WUDC, been the 4th best novice speaker and competed in a semi-final at Western IV and been the best novice speaker, 6th best overall speaker and competed in the final at East Malaya Open.
        I've broken as an adjudicator at several competitions including UCLA IV, Indo Pro-Am, UNSW Pre-Australs, Mac Pre-Australs, USU Open and UNSW Pre-Easters.  
      </p>

        I've also achieved a FIDE Blitz peak rating of 1827 and a USCF rating of 1635. I was 1st in the U1500 section of the Champaign Chess Championship #6, 1st at Inner West ACF Quick Tournament April 2023,
